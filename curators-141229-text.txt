Lake Street Dive at the Sinclair
Monday, December 29, at The Sinclair in Cambridge
Indie soul quartet Lake Street Dive ~ who formed ten years ago here in Boston when the members met at NEC ~ take the stage for a 3-night homecoming residency at The Sinclair after a big year. The strength of their acoustic jazz/gospel-blues is in it's simplicity ~ finely tuned and perfectly executed.

Roger Miller Surrealist Games / First Night
Wednesday, December 31, at Hynes Convention Center in Boston
If you're in the mood for something totally different this New Year's Eve head over to Hynes Convention Center for a truly unique First Night experience: Mission of Burma/Alloy Orchestra founding member Roger Miller curates and DJ's an evening of surrealistic games. This might just be the perfect ritual — interactive, creative, subversive — with which to observe 2014 slip into 2015.

Mondays With The Fringe
Monday, December 29, at Lilypad in Cambridge
A living treasure of the Boston jazz scene, The Fringe have been meeting on Monday nights to improvise freely for something like 40 years. The trio of tenor-saxophonist George Garzone, bassist John Lockwood, and drummer Bob Gullotti (with various guest musicians) are cream of the crop — all are music educators as well as in-demand session players, and there's never a dull moment at this long-running residency, showcasing stellar musicianship and well-honed communication.

New Year's Eve at Reginas Pizzeria
Wednesday, December 31, at Reginas Pizzeria in Allston
Skip the clubs and the trashy house party for something better this year — a free rock show at a pizza palace. Music blog denizens Allston Pudding gather together a trio of local high-spirited pop meisters to say so long to old man 2014 with cascading melodies and $2 pizza.

Will Mayo & Lexie Mountain
Monday, December 29, at Weirdo Records in Cambridge
Cambridge's most original record store hosts their last Monday show with fellow vinyl purveyor Will Mayo. This hard working show organizer channels his variegated skills as a deep-cut DJ and deep-fried hardware manipulator in what's sure to be a captivating performance of splintered techno and washed out sonic detritus.

Monday, December 29, at Zuzu in Cambridge
Its the last couple days before new year, so make it count by squeezing in some quality shows. 420-friendly fuzzed princess Colleen Green delivers equal parts wayfayer cool and 'my boyfriend is the best' romance with local garage rock revelers Spirit Kid and Beach Toys in tow.

Bach Cantata Series at Emmanuel Music
Sunday, January 4, at Emmanuel Church in Boston
Christmas Eve hath no more beautiful jam than that offered up by Emmanuel Music (Bach's magical "Susser Trost, mein Jesus kommt"). The organization's mission, to present the works of Bach in their appropriate liturgical setting, creates particularly radiant versions of these masterpieces on holidays -— and you can expect some of Boston's most warm-hearted musicians to be there.

----------
Flute and Viola Duos
Sunday, January 4, at Loring-Greenough House in Jamaica Plain
The height of classical fashion: this event's admission price also includes afternoon tea! Seriously, though, this promises to be a fun and graceful affair — and the intertwining of the flute's sweet tone with the dusky sound of the viola is one of my all-time favorite color combinations. And any time you can hear music right up close in an intimate space, you should — it's the absolute best way to experience it

Boston Baroque / New Year's Celebration / New Year's Eve
Wednesday, December 31, at Sanders Theatre in Cambridge
Boston Baroque has a long tradition of "letting its hair down" and getting festive for New Year's. This year, the offering is Cimarosa's one-act "Il Maestro da Capella" — a send-up of the age-old trope of the domineering conductor. Plus a whole bouquet of Mozart opera scenes! Soprano Sara Heaton and baritone Andrew Garland are both terrific — and fabulous actors — and this should be a fun and classy way to ring in 2015.

Jen Kirkman
, at Laugh Boston in Boston
Needham native Jen Kirkman is home for the holidays! According to her website the shows "will be regular stand-up shows but there will be extra holiday themed fun and stupidity and maybe some extra stories and more nonsense and goofing around." If you're not familiar with her work, she is a New York Time's Bestseller and can be seen regularly on Chelsea Lately and Comedy Central’s @midnight.
