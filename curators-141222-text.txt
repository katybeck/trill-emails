Live at The Lilypad: Gill Aharon Trio
Wednesday, December 24, at Lilypad in Cambridge
If you've ever been to the Lilypad (that tiny art gallery/performance space in Inman Square a few doors down from 1369) there's a good chance you've crossed paths with owner Gil Aharon and his two enormous German Shepherds. His trio — a funky, rhythmic, accomplished jazz group with motion and attitude in their compositions and delivery — play what is essentially Gil's basement on Christmas Eve, so this one may just have the intimacy (and no doubt the festivity) of a holiday house party.

Boston Pops Does Home Alone
Friday, December 26, at Boston Symphony Hall in Boston
In what I can only imagine as a somewhat surreal event, the Boston Pops perform live orchestral accompaniment to the 1990 film that made Macauley Culkin a household name. Composed by Pops Laureate Conductor John Williams, the score will no doubt gain a deeper appreciation in the hearts and minds of a live audience, as it underlines those quintessential moments of festivity, suspense, and slapstick hilarity in this classic holiday film.

The Freeways
Friday, December 26, at Plough and Stars in Cambridge
If you need to escape the holiday madness, chill out at the cozy Plough & Stars with a strong drink and unwind to the shoe-gazy, dreamy, psychedelic live sounds onstage this Boxing Day night. Anda Volley seduces with darkly poetic lo-fi indie, the Freeways sedate with a swirl of thick, effects-laden guitar and organs, and Moon Tower fills in the echoey space in between.

Rad Castle presents: So Sol, Thick Wild
Monday, December 22, at Zuzu in Cambridge
Get into that yuletide spirit with a robust and refreshing pair of acts making merry of the (often stale) exuberant americana folk format. So Sol inject latin flavor with flamenco flutters and sultry croons, while Thick Wild belt out a rough and sinewy hymn to heartache at cozy and warm ZuZu.

Soulelujah! w/ John Funke
Saturday, December 27, at Middle East Upstairs in Cambridge
Shake off the holiday hangover of eggnog and familial guilt with, what else but Soulelujah, perhaps this towns most fun and pretense-free regular dance night. Sip on some deep cuts of soul, funk, RnB and beyond with WMBR Backwoods host and preemeninent vinyl juggler John Funke!

Non-Event: Secret Diary (Jessica Rylan + Donna Parker) + Patrick Emm + TBC
Saturday, December 27, at Washington Street Gallery in Somerville
If your ears bend more towards the unexpected and experimental, turn your attention to well-curated Somerville gallery/all age venue WASC, where duo Secret Diary (Jessica Rylan and Donna Parker) manipulate pedals and mics in an unholy harmony with 'cassette fetishist' hazy manipulator Patrick Emm.

Bach Cantata Series at Emmanuel Music
Wednesday, December 24, at Emmanuel Church in Boston
Christmas Eve hath no more beautiful jam than that offered up by Emmanuel Music (Bach's magical "Susser Trost, mein Jesus kommt"). The organization's mission, to present the works of Bach in their appropriate liturgical setting, creates particularly radiant versions of these masterpieces on holidays -— and you can expect some of Boston's most warm-hearted musicians to be there.

Boston Pops Does Home Alone
Friday, December 26, at Boston Symphony Hall in Boston
A screening of Home Alone with LIVE orchestra. LIVE! I'm tickled pink. And not just that — the Boston Pops is probably the best orchestra to hear perform John Williams, period. It's gonna sound like a million bucks. It will probably sound better than it ever has, or will. You're going to have an amazing time.

----------
The Christmas Revels
Monday, December 22, at Sanders Theatre in Cambridge
True confessions: Revels barely squeezes into the classical corner. But that's OK — it still has violinists in 19th-century garb playing tunes, and we're flexible folk over here. This show switches national holiday traditions every year, but always pulls its audience members into the aisles and inspires us to get through the darkness of the solstice together.

Jen Kirkman
Friday, December 26, at Laugh Boston in Boston
Needham native Jen Kirkman is home for the holidays! According to her website the shows "will be regular stand-up shows but there will be extra holiday themed fun and stupidity and maybe some extra stories and more nonsense and goofing around." If you're not familiar with her work, she is a New York Time's Bestseller and can be seen regularly on Chelsea Lately and Comedy Central’s @midnight.

The SLUTCRACKER- A Burlesque
Monday, December 22, at Somerville Theatre in Somerville
Pointe shoes and Tchaikovsky... whips and pasties? This burlesque reimagining of the Nutcracker morphs Clara and Fritz into an engaged adult couple, and colorfully explores Clara's sexual awakening. Endless surprises and very creative satire make this a great choice for those looking for a new type of Christmas show with lots of laughs and adult entertainment.

Urban Nutcracker
Friday, December 26, at John Knowles Paine Concert Hall in Cambridge
Tony William's Urban Nutcracker fuses the familiar Tchaikovsky Nutcracker score with its Duke Ellington jazz interpretation. With way more than ballet onstage (read hip hop. tap, Flamenco, traditional Chinese, step and beyond), this Nutcracker is all about diversity in it's music, dance and performers. Go with your whole family or a group of friends for high energy holiday fun.
