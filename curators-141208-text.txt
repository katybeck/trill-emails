This is a really big week for Trill, and we’re ecstatic to share what we've been up to! This week our app, Trill Tonight, is launching in the app store. In celebration we dare you to take the Trill Challenge ( http://assets.trill.me/trillchallenge/ ) this Saturday — use our new app to experience as many shows as you can in one seriously epic day. Tell us about it to win some great stuff! The culminating event of the Trill Challenge is also the first installment of Trill Presents ( http://assets.trill.me/trill-presents-ripe-friends-showcase/ ), a series of live shows we've curated to highlight the best of the local Boston scene.

Varying Degrees of Discord
Thursday, December 11, at Gallery 263 in Cambridge
Curated by avant-garde veteran Matt Samolis, Varying Degrees of Discord is an evening of improvised and composed music with an emphasis on dissonance through unusual tuning systems, as well as unexpected uses of timbre, gesture and pacing.

Goli
Friday, December 12, at Gallery 263 in Cambridge
Cellist/vocalist Valerie Thompson and mrimbist Vessela Stoyanova's longterm musical relationship is clear from the way the two interact onstage. Both highly-skilled and fiercely passionate, the two communicate with self-deprecating humor and a relaxed lightness and love as they bring to life their contemporary chamber music and world-folk repertoire.

Black Beach & CreaturoS
Wednesday, December 10, at Middle East Upstairs in Cambridge
The friendly folk at Illegally Blind throw together yet another kickass garage rock feast, and guess what? They're all locals. It’s a psychedelic screwball party as Black Beach celebrate their record release with dazed chainers CreaturoS, festooned goons The Fagettes, and surrealistic comforters Magic Shoppe.

Eye Design Presents: Monogold, Magic Island, Skinny Bones, and Wakes
Saturday, December 13, at O'Brien's Pub in Allston
If you like your rock with less headbanging testosterone and more mellow, hynagogic grooves, then you should find yourself at O'Brien's in Allston this weekend, where perennial local show throwers Eye Design host NYC indie-clappers Monogold plus a trio of swell sounding locals.

The Series on Mondays: Walter Wright & Emilie Mouchous
Monday, December 8, at Weirdo Records in Cambridge
If you want to hear something a bit off the beaten path, just travel down that Cambridge beaut Mass Ave to that hole in the wall Weirdo Records, where each Monday proprietor Angela Sawyer hosts out-of-the-box performers of all stripes. This week the vinyl stacks hum along to the skittering and elusive improvisations from synth explorer Walter Wright and mouth feedback innovator Emilie Mouchous.

Gaudeamus! Music of Byrd, Josquin, and Turges
Friday, December 12, at St. Paul Church in Cambridge
If this extremely venerable group still sounds as rocking as they did on the old cassette tape of them belting out "Spem in Alium" that I used to play in the car while driving around the hills of Vermont as a wee lass… then run, don't walk, to this concert, and hear them do it live! They're part of that fascinating inaugural generation of early music geeks, and in their 39th BEMF performance, still have something fresh to say.

----------
George Frideric Handel - Messiah
Friday, December 12, at Jordan Hall in Boston
Messiah time! Boston Baroque's Grammy-nominated version is very well-seasoned; there's a lot of institutional memory involved, but that makes it even more fleet and supple in performance, as all the musicians who know the piece (and each other) let it elegantly flow out. I'd also keep an ear out for Dashon Burton's version of "The Trumpet Shall Sound." Extra perk: free community show on Sunday!

----------
All Aboard
Sunday, December 14, at Tsai Performance Center in Boston
I'm pretty sure that Richard Pittman couldn't design a boring program to save his life. The New England Philharmonic has a great tradition of compiling fantastic repertoire — or creating it from scratch. Here, the theme is music about trains; a pretty sweet genre. Including vocal magician David Kravitz in a rendition of "The Polar Express" and a family-friendly instrumental petting zoo at the end.

Thursday, December 11, at Royale in Boston
John Waters fills the stage with his opinions, humor and insight into modern American society.

Third Life Choreographer Series
Friday, December 12, at Third Life Studio in Somerville
The regularly-run Third Life Studio Choreographer Series is a supreme nod to the salon scene of eras past. You could see anything from polished repertory to engaging new works-in-progress by emerging artists and reknowned choreographers alike. Sure, there are no frills and you might feel like you're in someone's basement, but first-hand up-close experiences with intriguing choreography are guaranteed.

----------
The Sleeprunner
Friday, December 12, at Multicultural Arts Center in Cambridge
I will admit my bias to this show, but if you like your dance with a bit of narrative, a lot of fantasy and tons of attention paid to design The Sleeprunner is the show for you this week. With music ranging from Flying Lotus to rearranged Ella Fitzgerald tunes, gorgeous costumes built from scratch, and equal parts of intrigue and humor, don't miss your chance to explore this dance dream world.

----------
Echoes Tour Boston
Thursday, December 11, at BU Dance Theater in Boston
Fun fact: Boston is the first satellite destination of the REVERBdance Echoes Tour! This performance features choreographers from across the country and lets the audience select a favorite who will go on to show work in an NYC-based festival; great for those of us who value a bit of audience interaction with your intake of dance.
