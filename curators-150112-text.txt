We're thrilled to share the insights of a guest curator this week: long-time host of WBUR's Radio Open Source, Chris Lydon! He's a former New York Times reporter and WGBH anchor, die-hard Bostonian, and co-creator of the very first podcast, and this week he has dedicated his considerable knowledge of the local scene to finding some great things for us to do. Get to know Chris better on our blog ( http://trill.me/03737ec6 ), or check out all our great curator picks below!

Jerry Bergonzi
Monday, January 12, at Lilypad in Cambridge
Jazz joints, like hair-dressing shops, are supposed to take Mondays off. The exceptions are notable — like Bovi’s Tavern in East Providence which has been hosting the best of New England big-band players continuously since the 1940s and in recent years <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ0etYd3Cy8" target="_blank">John Allmark’s</a> all-star 16-piece version of the Basie and Ellington bands made new. Closer to home now we have the Lilypad in Inman Square, and on consecutive Monday nights this winter we are blessed with the tenor saxophone maestro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EjJvRJwfkk" target="_blank">Jerry Bergonzi</a> in a quartet from 8:30 to 10. Bergonzi can play with the fire of Coltrane and the finesse of Paul Desmond, whom he succeeded in Dave Brubeck’s quartet. He’s also one of those peculiar Boston types — a teacher’s teacher at the Berklee College of Music.

Stephen Drury Live in Concert
Thursday, January 15, at Jordan Hall in Boston
<a href="http://www.stephendrury.com/" target="_blank">Stephen Drury</a> is another of those Boston institutions, down the street at the New England Conservatory: an ever-surprising, deeply reflective, modernist original in the classical piano repertoire from Haydn to John Cage, who’s a Drury specialty. Thursday evening at Jordan Hall sounds like one of those expressive Drury introspections, linking the curious chain of stormy piano sonatas that Beethoven wrote all in the key of C-minor: the explosive Sonata No. 5; the breakthrough almost orchestral “Pathetique,” Sonata No. 8; and the final Sonata No. 32, speeding in the variations of the last movement toward a shimmering silence. A concert that could feel like an “event.”

Andris Nelsons conducts Mozart and Bruckner featuring pianist Lars Vogt
Thursday, January 15, at Boston Symphony Hall in Boston
<a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/pretty-cute-watching-boston-residents-play-daily-g,31554/" target="_blank">The Onion</a> mocks us Bostonians hustling and bustling through our “adorable little game of ‘Big City,’” as if we lived in a major metropolis. Well, we can take it. And Andris Nelsons at the helm of the Boston Symphony will keep the illusion alive a while longer. Is there anybody who doesn’t love this guy, in the orchestra or out? I fell madly for him in a <a href="http://radioopensource.org/andris-nelsons/" target="_blank">long gab for radio</a>. He’s a boisterous young athlete in an old man’s job — one of the rising 30-somethings in front of the great ensembles of the world. And still he seems younger than 36, and more different than we’d expected — almost childlike when he’s reaching out with an open-arm hug for the sound he wants from his players. This week he will be loving his way through the perfection of Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 24 with Lars Vogt at the keys. And then Bruckner’s Wagner-lit Symphony No. 7.

Composer Focus Series: Arvo Part
Sunday, January 18, at Lilypad in Cambridge
Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is known to have influenced Bjork and Thom Yorke with his "holy minimalism." At the fifth of this concert series, local players perform some of Pärt's best-known pieces, filling the tiny Lilypad with his sparse, reverential, ancient-sounding-yet-contemporary works for piano and strings.

Rad Castle: Player 2, Big Buck Hunter, Rosie & the Rosies, Steam Traktor
Monday, January 12, at Zuzu in Cambridge
When you're broke and lookin' for some Monday night entertainment, Rad Castle's residency at ZuZu is a sure (and always free) bet. Far-out guitar maestro Player 2 get proggy with a Boston trio of rousing and arousing basement brats: garage zoomers Big Buck Hunter, fuzzadelic swooners Rosie and the Rosies, and music school droolers Steam Traktor.

Non-event: Mickey O'Hara
Tuesday, January 13, at Cafe Fixe in Brookline
Non-event never disappoints in their curation; they always pick performers with an emphasis on experimentation in the messy boundaries between electronic processes and acoustic instrumentation. Sip some delish coffee and let your ears get bent into shape by Worcester-based Mickey O'Hara, longtime curator of the awesome Firehouse, member of psychonauts Gay Shapes, and an adept dabbler in tape loops and his ROLLZ-5 paper circuit bending drum machine.

Alosi Den, Underwater Bear Ballet, Cousin Clyde
Wednesday, January 14, at Midway Cafe in Jamaica Plain
Swirls of psychedelia arouse the wild spirits inside, opening our ears and minds to new terrains and perspectives. It may be hard to see anything in the haze at Midway this night with freak folk droner Alosi Den, blissed-beat jammers Underwater Bear Ballet, and acidic Syracuse shredder Cousin Clyde.

Stephen Drury Live in Concert
Thursday, January 15, at Jordan Hall in Boston
Put John Cage next to Ludwig van Beethoven at your dinner table and listen to their wide-ranging conversation. Early and late works of Cage (do yourself a favor and just go listen to "In A Landscape") rub elbows with two of the hugest and baddest late Beethoven sonatas. Meanwhile, Stephen Drury will make this all sound like the ink is still running off the freshly scribbled page, because that's just what he does.

Lawes-A-Thon
Saturday, January 17, at Edward M. Pickman Concert Hall in Cambridge
Do you have enough viola da gamba in your life? No. No, you do not. Address that issue with the ultimate adventure in binge-listening; a whole day of music for viols (and friends) by William Lawes, who met his untimely death on the battlefield exactly 370 years ago after having written a bunch of ravishing music. Hosted by the always collegial Longy early music community and a cornucopia of illustrious friends.

Sunday Concert Series: Julia Bullock, soprano and Renate Rohlfing, piano
Sunday, January 18, at Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston
The concept behind this program at the Gardner Museum is making my heart go pitter-pat. A heady blend of avant-garde music (Berio and Messaien; enfant terrible meets starry-eyed mystic) mixed with some extremely crunchy jazz (deeper cuts, not the standards) in one spectacular program featuring soprano Julia Bullock who sounds just fabulous. I adore this idea, and she's going to own it.
