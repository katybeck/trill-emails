Fluxion & Ricardo Donoso
September 24, Middlesex Lounge in Cambridge
Seminal UK electronic producer Fluxion shares his sparse, pulsating ambient dub techno with storied Boston-based dream-weaver Ricardo Donoso for this very rare and special showcase.

Yacht with White Fang
September 24, Brighton Music Hall in Brighton
If your ears want something a bit faster, driven, and soaked through with alcoholic adrenaline, then jump over to Allston to catch Portland synth pop dance-aholics Yacht and the infectiously enthusiastic and  hilarious slop rockers White Fang.

Felix Kubin performs “Paralektronoia”, Bromp Treb, DJ Angela Sawyer
September 26, Goethe-Institut in Boston
Proponents of vanguard Non-Event hosts storied synth wizard Felix Kubin, here giving a special lecture in conjunction with the performance of his ‘Paralekronoia.’ He’s joined by Neil Young Cloaca aka Bromp Treb, an experimentally-orientated performer who incorporates focused improvisations and purposely unstable systems like broken circuit boards to generated buzzsaw theatrics, as well as Weirdo Records denizen Angela Sawyer keeping the wax spinning strange.

Triple Helix
September 25, Tsai Performance Center in Boston
For the past 15 years, I've been enjoying performances by Triple Helix — a magically sympathetic piano trio that always manages to bring out another dimension in the repertoire it presents. Here, the trio opens the season with a luscious Brahms show for Music For Food, a wonderful and growing Boston charity that pairs concerts together with food pantries.

SeptemberFest
September 26, Edward M. Pickman Concert Hall in Cambridge
The Longy School of Music has a long tradition of kickstarting the season with its SeptemberFest, a series of innovative concerts that set the tone for the year. This year, faculty pull together music and the visual arts for a variety of experiences; improvised scores to films played in real time, "musical encounters to choreography, poetry, and animation" — it should be eye-opening in both the literal and metaphorical sense!

Guerilla Opera
September 27, The Zack Box Theater Boston Conservatory in Boston
I cannot wait to go see this crazy event! One random 1950's film - plus two opera composers who realize it in totally different ways — plus two cutting-edge directors (Giselle Ty is ridiculously compelling) who make versions of both of them — equals one four-part zany artistic offering in one li'l old evening. The Count would be over the moon!

Last Comic Standing
November 1, Laugh Boston in Boston
The famous NBC show, Last Comic Standing, is in town this week in search for their newest star. Go be part of the action, thrills, and excitment that only happens once a year. It's like Christmas but for stand-up comedians.

The Show Against Humanity
September 26, Improv Asylum in Boston
Awesome late night option for you night owls out there. At midnight every Friday, the amazing cast of Improv Asylum's Main Stage plays the popular game Cards Against Humanity with the audience which then inspires some improv scenes. It's probably the only place in Boston you'll ever get to see inappropriate yodeling.

My Brightest Diamond
Tonight! September 22, The Sinclair in Cambridge
High drama orchestral indie chamber pop from Shara Worden in support of the new album This Is My Hand.

---------------------
Diane Cluck
September 24, The Loft in Somerville
Diane Cluck is not your average folk singer — there is a somber ethereality to her music, and she delivers the rhythmic poetry of her lyrics in an even, plaintive cry that belies the intricacy of unlikely interval leaps and register jumps.

Chaparrals CD Release + Soft Pyramids
September 26, Aeronaut Brewing Company in Somerville
Languid indie-rock from the Chaparrals with Flaming Lips-esque dreaminess from Soft Pyramids.
