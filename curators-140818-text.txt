The Trill team was excited to meet you at the Women in MassChallenge Showcase last week. The lucky winner of our drawing was Kelly Brock, who won a pair of tickets to a show in September! Many of you who entered also shared a word or an anecdote along with your email: live shows made you feel "alive," "joyous," "connected to others," and "happy." We wholeheartedly agree!

Trill ( http://bit.ly/1svES32 ) sends one email a week filled with shows hand-picked by our savvy team of curators. Introducing Chris, Sarah, Mali, and Mary — our curators for rock and experimental music, comedy, classical music, and avant-garde music. They are impressive as performers and as people, and they are seriously hooked in to the Boston arts community. They'll help you find awesome and unique shows you wouldn't find otherwise. Keep reading for this week's picks, or head over to our blog to get to know them better ( http://bit.ly/1qWJPnx ).

--------------
Bent Shapes, Littlefoot, IAN and Wakes
August 21, TT The Bear's Place
Nothing lifts spirits like a solid combo of poignant pop from a gaggle of local chord-lovers. Get whipped up in a forlorn love frenzy with female-fronted Littlefoot and IAN (going on tour together) along with smart bopper Bent Shapes and slippery beach-fuzzers Wakes.

Frog Eyes, Skinny Bones
August 23, Red Room at Cafe 939

--------------
Landmarks Orchestra
August 20, Hatch Shell
The possibility of listening to Sibelius's heroic, sweeping, epic Symphony no. 2 outside under the stars should be tantalizing enough for you to run to Boston Landmarks' "Rhapsody in Green," which also features a bouquet (no pun intended) of smaller and more nimble works.
