----------
Medeski Scofield Martin & Wood
Sunday, December 7, at House of Blues in Boston
The ever-inventive funky and experimental trio Medeski Martin and Wood join forces with guitar master John Scofield in support of their fourth and most recent collaborative album, Juice. Expect masterful improvisation and an adventurous and acoustic acid jazz fusion that even the most inhibited audience member may not be able to resist moving to.

----------
Mirel Wagner
Saturday, December 6, at The Red Room at Cafe 939 in Boston
Ethiopian-born, Finland-raised Mirel Wagner sounds almost like a younger, less-affected Nico -- there is air in her voice, a brooding, understated melancholy in her sparse, acoustic guitar-backed songs, and a hint of mystery and foreshadowing in her bare delivery.

Improvisors Against Climate Change - Playing For The Planet
Friday, December 5, at The Community Church of Boston in Boston
Master musicians from vastly different musical traditions come together in an evening of "pan-cultural improvisation" to benefit environmental advocacy group 350MA.org. The tenth in the "Playing For The Planet" series features: Nima Janmohammadi, a contemporary master of Persian classical music; Triarky, an unorthodox jazz "power trio" with violin and electric tuba; and Hindustani classical singer Warren Senders.

The LAST pRIMORDIAL sOUNDS
Wednesday, December 3, at Middlesex Lounge in Cambridge
Fuzz-loving label and show throwers pRIMORDIAL sOUNDS have for 3 years now brought garage and psychedelia to the typically club-oriented Middlesex. Sadly their monthly residence comes to a close this month, but not before an all day anniversary bash with a cross section of local friends and weirdos. All proceeds goes into to producing a vinyl compilation of live performances from the past 3 years of shows!

----------
Vulnerable: A Marvin Gaye Tribute
Thursday, December 4, at Berklee Performance Center in Boston
Berklee's Signature Series takes an interesting turn with this, the first live performance of Marvin Gaye's Vulnerable, featuring a mighty cast of highly esteemed, genre blending performers. Should be a unique experience for those lovers of soul and RnB.

Boston Hassle: Hassle Night XMass Giveaway - Hands and Knees, Televibes, Miami Doritos
Saturday, December 6, at Lilypad in Cambridge
The seasonal cheer abounds at Boston Hassle's annual Holiday Party. Come early for free records and tapes and drinks (mmhmm), and stay for the great local rock. The devilishly delightful Hands and Knees play country-fried possum rock with Allston basement rats Miami Doritos and surf studs The Televibes.

Sweet Was the Song: Music for Christmas
Friday, December 5, at The Church of Advent Boston in Boston
A beautiful and reflective contemporary English holiday program. The voices of Boston Cecelia take on "Ex Maria Virgine," a work by John Tavener that flows from familiar to unfamiliar texts in an extended sequence. Plus a set of carols by Richard Rodney Bennett, who was big in the jazz and film world. This could be an exceedingly different and quite cool seasonal show.

----------
Antico Moderno
Friday, December 5, at First Lutheran Church in Boston
The first concert of a brand-new group that is dedicated to commissioning new music for early instruments. At the heart of the show are a set of dark and dreamy Venetian interludes, designed by Robert Honstein to accompany Vivaldi's bright and radiant "L'Estro Armonico" concerti. Plus two quirky responses to Bach works by Dan Schlossberg and Balint Karosi; it'll be a dance of the pretty old and very new!

----------
BMOP - Fantastic Mr. Fox
Sunday, December 7, at Jordan Hall in Boston
So guys... it turns out there's an OPERA about Roald Dahl's FANTASTIC MR. FOX. I suggest, politely, that that is all the information that we need, and that we should all simply go SEE THE OPERA BASED ON FANTASTIC MR. FOX.

Boston Center for the Arts Dance Residency Showcase, Angaje Sneak Peek with Jean Appolon Expressions
Friday, December 5, at Calderwood Pavilion in Boston
The Dance Residency at the BCA is amazing for dozens of reasons. One of those reasons is that they're currently hosting Jean Appolon Expressions, and the company is creating a brand new work that is set to officially debut in March. Go for a sneak peek on Saturday at 8pm to see the work in progress; with live percussion and folkloric music, Anganje depicts the recent violent surge against homosexual young men in Haiti.

Introduction: An Informal Dance Presentation by James Morrow
, at Salem State in Salem
Situation: You find yourself with no plans on Monday at about 11am in Salem. Your obvious next step is to go check out Introduction, a free showing by James Morrow. Some keywords in his personal work are perfection, perdition, intimacy, morality and sexuality. Watch thought-provoking dance (for free!) and stay for the discussion afterwards.

The Musical of Musicals! (The Musical)
Thursday, December 4, at BCA Plaza Theatre in Boston
Witty, hilarious, a smidge ridiculous. You might not get the references if you're not a musical theater fan, but you'll certainly get your money's worth in laughs, dance and great performances.
