Boston Landmarks Orchestra performs O'er the Land of the Free: Bicentennial of The Star-Spangled Banner
August 27, Hatch Shell
This may be the moment to let your heart swell with patriotic pride and swoon to this program built around our national anthem. Beethoven's Symphony no. 8 and Fidelio overture (rock on!) were both composed in its inaugural year, and celebratory works by Ives and Gandolfi keep it as contemporary as the country itself.

An Italian Sendoff for the Summer
September 1, First Lutheran Church
This Labor Day concert features First Lutheran's world-class organist (no joke; he won the prestigious Leipzig Bach Competition!) Bálint Karosi, playing a set of wonderfully flamboyant works by Baroque masters with recorder virtuoso Héloise Dégrugillier and clear-voiced soprano Audrey Fernadez-Fraser.

Chris's picks this week:


Joanna Gruesome, Perfect Pussy, Pottymouth, Love Is Everything
August 27, Sinclair
These days the best rock bands around are led by seriously righteous women following in the footsteps of their Riot Grrl forebearers. This show — featuring English harmonizers Joanna Gruesome, New York noise shredders Perfect Pussy and jangly western Mass college rock cruisers Pottymouth — is a case in point.

This show epitomizes the DIY ethos and perfect antidote to the stubborn notion that only ‘talented geniuses’ can be successful, compelling artists. The monthly Cheap Seats brings a vertibable gaggle of performers of a variety of styles and genres, including many first-timers to the ‘stage.’
