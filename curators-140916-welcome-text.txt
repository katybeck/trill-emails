Ride The Snake 5th Anniversary
September 20, Boylston Congregational Church in Jamaica Plain
One of my favorite local labels keeping pop weird, Ride the Snake celebrates 5 years with a grand show featuring a good half of their artists at a unique space — the Boylston Church in JP. Sweet pop gliders Phantom Rides and elastic angst gripped groovers SaraLee join old favs Reports and Cuffs — who haven't played for some time — along with the great Life Partners and Half Sour.

Changing Colors
September 20, First Church in Boston in Boston
The standout piece on this "seasons" program (Boston in the fall!) is Respighi's "Il Tramonto" (The Sunset) — a too-beautiful, too-melancholy masterwork that mezzo-soprano Krista Rivers sings with quiet devastating passion.

Always questioning, always innovating, the Borromeo Quartet (known for performing off autographs and scores displayed on laptops) turns its attention to a new series at the Gardner exploring "old school" (Tchaikovsky) and "new school" (Shostakovich) Russian string quartet writing.
