Gem Club with SEOUL
Tonight! Monday, October 27, at T.T. the Bear's Place in Cambridge
The stunning acoustic-ambient trio Gem Club play music so delicate, so sparse, so spacious and so painfully beautiful you will be forgiven for breaking into tears on the floor of this somewhat grungy rock club.

Halloween Show with What Time Is It, Mr. Fox?
Wednesday, October 29, at the Beat Hotel in Cambridge
Sip on a cocktail or two at this swanky shoestore-turned restaurant/lounge while being wooed by the smoky, sultry neo-soul cabaret of Boston's What Time Is It, Mr. Fox? Frontman Brian King knows how to work a crowd with his fluttery falsetto and lyrics of ill-fated love.

Lorelei Ensemble
Friday, October 31, at Boston University's Marsh Chapel
This eight-voice women's ensemble is an audacious, elegant, and extremely interesting newcomer to the Boston scene. Their concerts are gorgeously curated, and filled with new music, much of which they've commissioned. In "Reconstructed", some ancient New England music of William Billings is juxtaposed with four (!) premieres, which reference an "American mass", Hiawatha, an Appalachian ballad, and the North Woods.

Vivaldi L'Estro Armonico
Friday, October 31, at New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall
Vivaldi decided to call his first collection of concertos L'Estro Armonico — or "the inspiration/stimulous/heat/frenzy of harmony." They really do sound that insanely good/insane, and H+H concertmaster Aislinn Nosky who leads this concert is just the sort of rock star to bring them to thrilling life. Please stop thinking all those thoughts about relaxing baroque music and go have your socks blown off by these sounds.

The Parker Quartet
Sunday, November 2, at Harvard University Paine Hall in Cambridge
Simply put, the Parker Quartet is really, really, really, excellent at what they do and it is a pleasure to hear them do it. They're in their first year of a Harvard residency and tearing it up with a raunchy Prokofiev quartet, a perfectly detailed series of Kurtag aphorisms, and a Schubert quartet that will leave you breathless; a statement which is so fundamentally corny that I promise I would only write it if it were absolutely true.
