Without further ado, we present this week's picks from our savvy team of curators! We like them so much, we sent the Trill Team out last week to see a few shows from our first newsletter, and a little birdy tells us they had a blast (hint: celebrity selfies were involved). Keep an eye out on our blog ( http://bit.ly/1qWJPnx ) tomorrow as they share their experiences, or head over and explore the awesome live shows coming up on Trill ( http://bit.ly/1svES32 ).

Curator Picks: Avant-Garde Music
Mali Sastri


Singer Mali is a singer, songstress, multimedia events producer, and experimental arts lover hailing from Lexington, MA. After stints in London and New York, Mali settled at Cloud Club, an artists' co-op in Boston's South End, where she fronts the dark avant pop band, Jaggery ( http://jaggery.org ) and curates the performance series Org. As a performer, Mali has toured nationally and internationally, yet whether on the road or at home in her cozy apartment, her Sagitarrius spirit always has her seeking the new, the different, and the weirdly beautiful.

Nuda Veritas, Powerslut, Lesbian Tank Top, Anda Volley
August 12, O'Briens
Solo performer Nuda Veritas creates layers and loops with her siren-like voice and guitar to support her powerful, emotion-driven ballads. Anda Volley's dark and sparse indie rock provides a backdrop for the finely crafted poetry of her lyrics.

Lilting and lovely, Mazzy Starr-esque melancholy beneath childlike vocals and harmonies.

Landmarks Orchestra
August 13, Hatch Shell
The Landmarks Orchestra gives Boston a huge summertime gift with its weekly Hatch Shell concerts. I'm particularly excited about this program of music inspired by spirituals that leads all the way back to the magical slow movement from Dvorak's "New World" symphony.

Mercury Orchestra
August 16, Sanders Theater at Harvard University
The Mercury Orchestra is the sort of amateur orchestra that makes you glad to be alive as you hear them tear into a huge and ridiculously difficult piece… and bring it to its knees. There are so many great musicians in this town that chose not to go pro — and hearing them come together in this summer affair is always an inspiration.

Curator Picks: Comedy
Mary Largenton


Mary is a heartbreaker, dream maker, and love taker. She is also an active improviser immersed in the Boston comedy scene. Currently, Mary is living out every little girl's dream planning private events for Improv Asylum & Laugh Boston. When not moonlighting as Pat Benatar, you can catch Mary performing at Improv Boston's Harold Night, Improv Asylum's House Teams, and on various indie improv teams around the city.
