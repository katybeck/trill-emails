This week marks a first for the Trill weekly picks. Both Mali (our avant-garde curator), and Chris (our rock/experimental curator) have recommended the same event: abstract and experimental series Non-Event welcomes musician and artist Mark Fell this week to perform his new piece called "long mix boston" at the Waterworks Museum in Chestnut Hill. Double the curators means double the awesome, so check it out!

Here are all of this week's picks from Chris, Sarah, Mary, and Mali:

Non-Event: Mark Fell
Wednesday, November 5, at Waterworks Museum in Boston

Dinnersss, Couples Counseling, Home Body, Citrusphere
Thursday, November 6, at Lilypad in Cambridge

Hassle Fest 6: Boston's Underground Music Fest
Friday, November 7, at Cuisine en Locale in Somerville
Those DIY diehards at the Hassle (full disclosure: I'm one of 'em) are throwing their biggest event of the year: two days of mind melting rock riffs, weirdo sound collage, and astral pop from Boston and around the country. With 40+ bands — including Body Head (Kim Gordon + Bill Orcutt), No Joy, Guerilla Toss, Debo Band, etc — playing back to back in a rapid fire succession, this beast is one not to take lightly.

Andris Nelsons conducts Gubaidulina and Sibelius featuring violinist Baiba Skride
Friday, November 7, at Boston Symphony Hall in Boston
Sibelius's Second Symphony is one of these pieces that you really have to hear every now and again, in the same way that you need to see those great panoramas of New Zealand in the Lord of the Rings movies. Why fight it? Especially when you can get your classy new music grove on with an amazing work by Sofia Gubaidulina in the first half… simultaneously mystical, intellectual, and eerily beautiful, her "Offertorium" is just magnificent.

JACK Quartet: Haas String Quartet, No. 3 “In iij. Noct”
Saturday, November 8, at Institute of Contemporary Arts in Boston
Drop everything when these guys are in town, and go find out whet they're up to. The JACK Quartet is made up of four inquisitive musicians who are willing to ride the restless wave of the avant-garde to its most challenging and fascinating destinations. This evening: a quartet written to be performed in total darkness. Don't blink.

Winds of Music, Passing On
Saturday, November 8, at First Church in Boston
Chameleon is made up of some of the most colorful chamber musicians in the Boston scene, and its concerts are delicately and carefully composed — to the extent that every program is prefaced by a line from a poem! Here, 19th-century lovebirds Robert and Clara Schumann take center stage, flanked by twentieth-century works that gently recall their sensibilities. You'll probably have the slow movement of the Piano Quartet stuck in your head after this show — and that's a good thing!

The Naked Roots Conducive
Thursday, November 6, at Outpost 186 in Cambridge
A NYC-based strings-and-vox duo whose unusual sound might be described as avant musical theater — a dramatic, operatic, raw combination of performance art and acoustic noise.

Becca Stevens/ America Echoes
Friday, November 7, at The Red Room at Cafe 939 in Boston
