Here at Trill it is an exciting time of the year — the weather is sunny and crisp (for now), and our team has returned energized and inspired from the Hacking Arts festival this weekend (read more about it on our blog ( http://bit.ly/1vHRZxR )!). Most of all we are thrilled by the exhilarating array of things to see and do as Boston's performing arts scene roars into its fall season.

Do yourself a favor and check out this week's picks from Chris, Sarah, and Mali. Your Sunday self will thank you!

Immigrant Union (ex Dandy Warhols), Avi Jacob, So Sol, Thick Wild
Wednesday, October 8, at T.T the Bears Place in Cambridge
Good times pervade with loose psych roots vibes of Australian- based Immigrant Union (mem. Dandy Warhols), with Carolina hayride crooner Avi Jacob singing smooth with verdant So Sol, and boisterous folkers Thick Wild

BASSIC presents The Bug, Manga, Damian Silva, Scotch1, Moldy
Friday, October 10The Good Life in Boston
There's a handful of consistently quality dance nights in Boston and BASSIC is one. Prolific producer The Bug (aka Kevin Martin) pushes those subs to the limit with grime gripper Manga and rock solid residents Damian Silva, Scotch1 and Moldy

Young Adults (final show!), California X, Soccer Mom, Earthquake Party
Sunday October 12, at T.T the Bears Place in Cambridge
The interminably boisterous punks Young Adults are calling it quits, but not before a final blowout show with a trio of fellow locals dedicated to bringing the noise and distortion to the pop format. California X (w. MA), Soccer Mom, Earthquake Party shred hard

Handel and Haydn Society present Baroque Fireworks
Friday, October 10, at Boston Symphony Hall in Boston
200 is a big deal, and we'll likely be hearing the sound of fireworks all year long from H+H's corner as they celebrate a rare and spectacular musical bicentennial. This season-opener of Handel and Vivaldi is just ridiculously delightfully over-the-top and it will likely be the beginning of a whole lot of awesome.

Boston Early Music Festival Chamber Ensemble
Saturday, October 11Jordan Hall in Boston
The Boston Early Music Festival brings a lot of great music to town, but its homegrown productions are reliably the most stylish and illuminating. Here, six supercool hotshot early music divas take on Monteverdi's epoch-changing eighth book of madrigals "Songs of Love and War," backed up by an ensemble whose virtuosity lies in the ultimate mastery of gesture.

Radius Ensemble
Saturday, October 11Edward M. Pickman Concert Hall in Cambridge
The Radius Ensemble always has fabulous eclectic programming in its corner (fueled by its dynamic mix of winds and strings) but this first concert looks especially delicious - with fresh works like Randall Woolf's …nobody move for solo piano and Kaija Saariaho's airy "Vent Nocturne" for viola and electronics pairing up with a chipper classic (Barber's "Summer Music") and an eternal sunset (Schubert's amazing Cello Quintet)

Boston gets a glimpse of one of the biggest rock bands in Beijing -- Secondhand Rose, who blend traditional Chinese folk music with rock'n'roll.

-------------
Warpaint
Wednesday, Oct 8th, at Royale in Boston
Moody and melancholic art-rock drenched in reverb with the occasional experimentation of time signature and instrumentation (their drummer plays buckets on a recent KEXP appearance).
More info ( http://bit.ly/1oJVujj )


-------------
Markéta Irglová
Saturday, October 11th, at The Sinclair in Cambridge
Czech-born singer/songwriter whose voice you may know from her Academy Award-winning duet with Glen Hansard, "Falling Slowly" from the film "Once." Fragile, piano-based classical-tinged folk loveliness.
