======== Weekly Picks from Trill! ========
===================================

This past weekend the Trill team trekked over the city with a film crew (more on that soon!) to experience a wide variety of live shows. We raised a pint, jumped on stages, danced in a rain of disco glitter, and even shook handkerchiefs in a second line — and were blown away by the countless tiny, magical, and unscripted moments that came along with each "official" show.

Here at Trill we are so grateful to spend every day connecting people to those experiences, and to be a part of such a thriving community of people who enjoy them. From our family to yours, we wish you all a Thanksgiving full of your own tiny, magical, and unscripted moments.


- Kathleen, Katy, 
and the Trill Team

Gabriel Kahane
Monday, November 24, at The Red Room at Cafe 939 in Boston

All Of Us Comedy ≈ November 26TH / 7PM
Wednesday, November 26, at Lilypad in Cambridge
Avant-garde comedy becomes a thing when Kelly Roberge's All of Us Quartet takes the stage — a one-man band gone decidedly and hilariously wrong in all the right, and creatively unexpected ways. Also featuring jazz clarinetist Alec Spiegelman and an array of Boston comics.

2nd Annual Black Friday THANGsgiving !
Friday, November 28, at Somerville Armory in Somerville
A full-day of Black Friday musical experimentation featuring many of the movers and shakers of Boston's avant-garde scene. Get started with a participatory movement warm-up, then careen headlong into performative adventures in new instruments, what the organizers are calling "free-range dance and thought-speech" and world premiers of original scores.

The Lentils, Peter’s Window (mem. Great Valley), Jarva Land and the Sharkbag Collective
Tuesday, November 25, at Deep Thoughts JP in Jamaica Plain
Peer through the cracks in the peeling wallpaper to find creepy crawlies weaving an intracte web of outsider pop brilliance. Swing softly with imaginative outpourings of Vermont's finest freaks The Lentils and Peter's Window rocking that raw and minimal sweet rot groove with New Hampshire devotional VU creamers Jarva Land and the Sharkbag Collective, all at the lovely Deep Thoughts record store.

Smash It Dead Benefit: Necklacing, Warfukker, Harami, Rejiem, Compassion Fatigue
Friday, November 28, at The Democracy Center in Boston
What better way to work off those turkey calories and family PTSD than with a barn-burning punk show for a damn good cause. The fine folks at Smash It Dead raise funds for their annual fest with a mini riot of rapid-fire riffs, friendly moshing and political awareness at the stalwart DIY space the Democracy Center in Harvard Square.

Live at the Lilypad: Willy Mason, Goat of Arms, Saralee, Bong Wish, Aclu Benefit
Saturday, November 29, at Lilypad in Cambridge
Go full local this Saturday with this eclectic showcase of talent spanning the wide breadth of what we call "pop." Tango with the sparse and highly charged 2-piece SaraLee, lazy sweet bedroom ditties of Bong Wish, the moving odes of tearjerking bard ACLU Benefit, plus cumbia drum duo Goat of Arms and new supergroup Willy Mason (ft. Nina Violet, Noah Bond and Jesse Gallagher).

Bartók, Haydn and Mussorgsky featuring Leonidas Kavakos, conductor and violin
Tuesday, November 25, at Boston Symphony Hall in Boston
Leonidas Kavakos is one of these musicians' musicians that make people in the biz lose their cool and look really cute for a second when they talk about how excited they are to go hear him. My guess is that his Bartók will be revelatory, the Haydn will be fresh and in-your-face, and the Mussorgsky will sound like a million bucks with a few choice twists. But there's only one way to know for sure…

BEMF Chamber Opera Series: OperaPergolesi’s La serva padrona and Livietta e Tracollo
Saturday and Sunday, November 29–30, at Jordan Hall in Boston
Every two years, the Boston Early Music Festival puts on a killer opera that people travel from around the world to see as the centerpiece of its week-long summer Festival. This is the next best thing; the same musical leadership and amazing singing (and dancing and costuming and baroque gesture and omg), but in a more intimate and semi-staged chamber setting. Besides all that, Pergolesi's "La Serva Padrona" is HILARIOUS.

First Monday
Monday, December 1, at Jordan Hall in Boston
Lawrence Lesser has been curating free chamber music concerts on the first Monday of every month for 30 years, featuring the world-class faculty members of NEC and their special guests. Jordan Hall is packed with enthusiastic listeners "in the know" about these events. This Monday, it's a set of soulful Josquin Dez Prez madrigals, then the dulcet tones and wild phrases of Debussy's Sonata for Flute, Viola, and Harp, and to finish, the maniacal intensity of Shostakovich's Second Piano Trio.

Vanity Project at The Improv Asylum
Wednesday, November 12, at Improv Asylum in Boston
Great fully improvised show done by Improv Asylum. The cast is a mix of seasoned improvisers from the owners of Improv Asylum and alumni to up and coming members of their Main Stage, and NXT.

Phédre
Wednesday, November 19, at First Church in Boston in Boston
If you think your family is impossible around the Thanksgiving table, Actors' Shakespeare Project's Phédre will teach you a lesson or two. An epic Greek tragedy centered around a mother's burning desire for her stepson (and about a thousand more troubles), this play showcases drama in all of the best ways. PS- If you didn't figure it out, this show doesn't involve dance but adds a bit of variety to my recommendations for your viewing pleasure.

Mikko Nissinen's The Nutcracker
Friday, November 28, at Boston Opera House in Boston
Boston Ballet's Nutcracker is just about the best way to get yourself in the holiday spirit. The music is pure nostalgia, the choreography is meticulous, the costumes and sets are dazzling and everyone in the audience is happy, from the twenty-somethings sipping wine on your right, to the toddlers crinkling wrappers and swaying to the music a few rows up.

The Donkey Show
Saturday, November 22, at Oberon in Cambridge
One of Boston's many college students with nowhere to go for the holiday? Drown your sorrows on the dance floor and drink to your self pity at OBERON in this disco-fied version of A Midsummer Night's Dream. If the club-vibe and the funky Shakespeare haven't intrigued you, might I dangle supreme roller-skating and tons of glitter?
