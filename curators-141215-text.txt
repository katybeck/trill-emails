Eldridge Rodriguez, PowerSlut, The I Want You and Sundog
Friday, December 19, at O'Brien's Pub in Allston
New Orleans-transplant Sundog truly makes a joyful noise. Wearing a bright orange spaceman's suit and helmet, the multi-instrument-wielding loop artist and singer creates layers of the most soulful, catchy, dance-able grooves imagineable. If there's any justice in the world, this guy is gonna be huge one day — see him tonight at the tiny O'Brien's and wear your dancing shoes.

Adam Glasseye and The Insect Fable, with As The Sparrow
Saturday, December 20, at Lizard Lounge in Cambridge
I for one cannot wait for this show — after stumbling upon As The Sparrow's infectious "folk-swing" on bandcamp, I'm itching to see this energetic sometimes-7-piece perform their bright, jangly, twangy, signature big-band-meets-folk to a live room.

Black Beach & CreaturoS
, at Middle East Upstairs in Cambridge
The friendly folk at Illegally Blind throw together yet another kickass garage rock feast, and guess what? They're all locals. It’s a psychedelic screwball party as Black Beach celebrate their record release with dazed chainers CreaturoS, festooned goons The Fagettes, and surrealistic comforters Magic Shoppe.

Eye Design Presents: Monogold, Magic Island, Skinny Bones, and Wakes
, at O'Brien's Pub in Allston
If you like your rock with less headbanging testosterone and more mellow, hynagogic grooves, then you should find yourself at O'Brien's in Allston this weekend, where perennial local show throwers Eye Design host NYC indie-clappers Monogold plus a trio of swell sounding locals.

The Series on Mondays: Walter Wright & Emilie Mouchous
, at Weirdo Records in Cambridge
If you want to hear something a bit off the beaten path, just travel down that Cambridge beaut Mass Ave to that hole in the wall Weirdo Records, where each Monday proprietor Angela Sawyer hosts out-of-the-box performers of all stripes. This week the vinyl stacks hum along to the skittering and elusive improvisations from synth explorer Walter Wright and mouth feedback innovator Emilie Mouchous.

An American Christmas: Newbury
Thursday, December 18, at First Parish Church of Newbury in Newbury
Boston Camerata's already-well-loved "An American Christmas" jumps back into our own musical traditions from a couple hundred years ago. Early American Christmas music is nicely crunchy, gutsy, and varied, and we should all be singing a lot more of it. Go take a listen to what you're missing! It's a great part of our own holiday history.

Down in Yon Forest: A Solstice Concert
Tuesday, December 16, at Eliot Church of Newton in Newton
Take a break from the big stages and go check out this friendly-with-a-hint-of-rowdy group as they celebrate the solstice with all manner of carols and swanky from different countries and traditions. It will be intimate and delightful. There will be dancing. You, yes, you, will dance.

Composer Focus Series: Alfred Schnittke
Sunday, December 21, at Lilypad in Cambridge
Step back from the holiday swirl and see what it's like to be the Grinch for a night. Alfred Schnittke's dark musical vision is the focus of this month's Lilypad adventure, curated by cellist Nick Dinnerstein. A small room with an open bar and musicians inches away playing avant-garde Russian music that conjures up infinite ironic agony? Gotta love it.

Improv Jones with Mass Mouth
Saturday, December 20, at Riot Theater in Jamaica Plain
Two my personal favorite art forms collide this week. Listen to powerful well told stories by members of Mass Mouth and see the cast of Improv Jones do comic scenes based off those stories.

An evening with Bill Nye
Thursday, December 18, at Wilbur Theatre in Boston
