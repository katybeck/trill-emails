Curator Picks: Avant-Garde Music
Mali Sastri
--------------------------------
--------------------------------

Singer Mali is a singer, songstress, multimedia events producer, and experimental arts lover hailing from Lexington, MA. After stints in London and New York, Mali settled at Cloud Club, an artists' co-op in Boston's South End, where she fronts the dark avant pop band, Jaggery ( http://jaggery.org ) and curates the performance series Org. As a performer, Mali has toured nationally and internationally, yet whether on the road or at home in her cozy apartment, her Sagitarrius spirit always has her seeking the new, the different, and the weirdly beautiful.

Mali's picks this week:



--------------------------------
Arielle Vakni, Two Girls
September 8, Middle East Upstairs
With a rich voice reminiscent of Jenn Wasner of Wye Oak, recent Berklee grad Arielle Vakni creates music she calls folk-electronic, which ebbs and flows, supported by strings, guitar, and tight rhythmic juxtapositions.

Illegally Blind + KYLAM Records: CreaturoS, Electric Street Queens (KYLAM Tape Release) Nice Guys, Fur Purse
September 10, Church of Boston
Fuzzed out garage rock is back with a vengeance these days, and Boston features some of the most wild and original bands of this fun-loving resurgence.

Boston Hassle Presents: Prolifigate, Outride (FL), Via App, DJ Won’t
September 11, Club Bohemia (Cantab Lounge)
Electronic Dance Music may have unprecedented popularity in the States these days, but its hard to find something outside the 4/4 hyperengerized schlog. SCANNERS (hosted by Boston Hassle and Open Loop) are the antidote to the mundane, what with weirdo ripper Prolifigate (NC) flanging out with rhythm rinser Outride (FL) and local house heads Via App and DJ Won’t.

A Far Cry with Augustin Hadelich
