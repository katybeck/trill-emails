------------------------------------------------

This week at Trill we are introducing curated recommendations. We'll be sending a weekly collection of events brought to you by curators in three really interesting Boston scenes: comedy, classical, and avant-garde music. Keep an eye out as we introduce new curators in theater, dance and other musical genres in the coming weeks!

Comedy
Mary Largenton
-----------

Mary is heartbreaker, dream maker, and love taker. She is also an active improviser immersed in the Boston comedy scene. Currently, Mary is living out every little girl's dream planning private events for Improv Asylum & Laugh Boston. When not moonlighting as Pat Benatar, you can catch Mary performing at Improv Boston's Harold Night, Improv Asylum's House Teams, and on various indie improv teams around the city. For complaints about the MBTA and pictures of other people's pets, follow Mary on Twitter & Instagram @marymeplease.

Mary's picks this week:

Brian Posehn
August 7–9, Laugh Boston
You probably don't recognize him by name but you've been watching Brian Posehn for years… and you're probably already huge fan! Brian has been killing it in guest starring roles on TV and in movies since the 90s and has been rocking his nerdy persona in the stand-up world at the same time. Brian is headlining Laugh Boston’s Comic-con themed weekend.

Awkward Compliment
Thursdays, Somerville Theater
Best bang for your buck in Boston! Well, OK, Somerville technically. Each week the indie improv troupe, Awkward Compliment, hosts a variety show of local stand-ups and other improv troupes from the Greater Boston area. It's only $5, and it all happens at the Somerville Theater, the heart of Davis Square.

-----------
Classical
Sarah Darling
-----------
Performing leading roles on viola and violin with Boston Baroque, Musicians of the Old Post Road, the Harvard Baroque Chamber Orchestra, Emmanuel Music, Gut Reaction, Les Bostonades, Musical Offering, A Far Cry, and Boston Early Music Festival, Sarah knows everyone and everything in the Boston classical music scene. She has recorded old and new music for Naxos, Linn, Paladino, Azica, MSR, and Centaur Records. She is a Harvard alum and is currently finishing a doctorate at the New England Conservatory.

Sarah's picks this week:

Boston Lyric Opera
August 6, Hatch Shell
Opera at the Hatch Shell? It doesn't get more Boston-in-the-summertime than this. Kick back, relax, and get ready to tear up in all the right places as the world-class artists of the Boston Lyric Opera light up the stage.

Arceci Quartette
August 8, Taylor House
Recipe for an utterly delightful evening: Taylor House, Jamaica Plain's elegant, music-friendly B+B, hosts a distinguished group of Boston's early musicians playing the sensuous music of the French Baroque.

Boston Opera Collaborative
August 10, Olmsted Park
In recent years, the Boston Opera Collaborative has been taking off like a rocket, embracing an impressive variety of cutting-edge projects. Chances are that even this relaxed show in one of Boston's beautiful Emerald Necklace parks will include some off-the-beaten-path surprises!

Avant-Garde Music
Mali Sastri
-----------
Singer Mali is a singer, songstress, multimedia events producer, and experimental arts lover hailing from Lexington, MA. After stints in London and New York, Mali settled at Cloud Club, an artists' co-op in Boston's South End, where she fronts the dark avant pop band, Jaggery ( http://jaggery.org ) and curates the performance series Org. As a performer, Mali has toured nationally and internationally, yet whether on the road or at home in her cozy apartment, her Sagitarrius spirit always has her seeking the new, the different, and the weirdly beautiful.

Mali's picks this week:

Orchestra Morphine for 2 shows! A Salute to Mark Sandman — 15 Years Gone But Not Forgotten.
August 6, Lizard Lounge
The two surviving members of Boston band Morphine, drummer Billy Conway and saxophonist Dana Colley, regroup with a nine-piece line-up of Boston musicians to pay tribute to Mark Sandman, who died onstage fifteen years ago at age 46. These shows are technically sold out, but I hear a couple tickets might be available at the door...

Club D'elf
August 8, Lizard Lounge
Club D'elf, fronted by bassist Mike Rivard, creates a swirling, textured, trance-inducing aural elixir combining both acoustic and electronic, and elements of jazz, world, rock, and hip-hop. This long-standing, every-other-Friday-night-at-the-Lizard-Lounge residency showcases some of the Boston area's finest jazz musicians — Berklee professors frequently drop-in as well as notables like John Medeski — and the usually sold-out, cramped-quarters of the Lizard Lounge does not deter audience members from dancing between the tables.
